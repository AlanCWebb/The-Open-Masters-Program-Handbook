# About the Open Master's Program

Mastery is the combination of specific skills, knowledge, and experiences that would allow other professionals in your field to recognize you as a peer.  The Open Masters program is a framework for an experience that can be used by any group of people to cultivate mastery in whatever field they like, through an intentional process of study and skill building with other peers and mentors.

The Open Masters is a commitment that requires considerable persistence and motivation.   All of the specific details of your Open Masters- and the ultimate title- will be designed by you- together with your peers and mentors- according to your unique needs. In general, it requires:
1. Creating and following individualized plans and routines for self-directed learning.
2. Completing many different types of learning experiences and projects- including courses, research projects, work-study, or any other type of experience that works for you.
3. Creating a portfolio of work that demonstrates your strengths, skills, and knowledge.
4. Completing a final project and public presentation showcasing all of those strengths, skills and knowledge to the community.
5. Submitting your work for open peer review by the rest of the Open Masters community.
6. Ultimately, receiving letters of endorsement from your peers and co-mentors, and from other organizations if you choose to do so.

That process may range for each person from one year to many years- or as long as needed.  But the Open Masters is more of a journey than a destination.  Detours along the way are acceptable and, in fact, encouraged.  Understanding what unique gifts you have to give the world can be a long process. Its perfectly normal not to have the answer right away; the Open Masters can be an experience both for discovering and of cultivating those gifts over time.

## Organization
The Open Masters is not a traditional degree or accredited program.  It is an experience for which great respect is given to anyone who completes it, which is validated by a process of open peer review, according to expectations written in this handbook and upheld by members of this community.

The Open Masters is an open source framework and a process.  It not created by a single organization.  There is no organization to grant you a degree, to organize your learning for you, or to collect a tuition fee from you.  There are no Open Masters committees to admit you, grade you, or pass you, either.

Instead, the Open Masters is constantly being created and recreated by small motivated groups of peers for each other.  All organizers of the Open Masters are also participants.  All participants are also contributing in some way to the experience of others.  We do that by being part of teams that do all of the essential work of the Open Masters- including stewarding the Open Masters framework and global community- and by organizing and supporting our local Open Masters groups.

## About this Handbook
The Open Masters Handbook outlines the Open Masters process in greater detail such that any group of people can use it to create this journey together.   It outlines some minimum expectations- about the process you are completing, the criteria used for peer evaluation, and the values which the Open Masters community upholds- and some resources to help you with different steps in the process.  

But remember; you will have to find your own path.  Any and all means that you feel move you closer to the goal of mastery are fair game.  This guide should be seen only as the starting point.   

At the time of publishing this version of the Open Masters Handbook, a full Open Masters program has not yet been completed.  Therefore, this guide is- for now- a working draft being actively used and refined by an entrepreneurial community of early adopters, but it is not yet fully tested by experience. Therefore, your experience using it, and your ideas, will heavily influence future versions of this guide.

## Thanks to Supporters
The first two versions of this handbook were developed by Alan Webb over the course of June and July, 2012 and completed at the Berlin Popup Residency of Peer-2-Peer-University, thanks to a micro-grant from P2PU and Shuttleworth Foundation.  Thanks also to the contributions of many early readers, from Hub DC, Knowledge Commons DC, Ashoka U, Mycelium, Think Outword, Knowmads, and many others. 

## Some Terms
**“Open”** means:

* **Open admissions**
* Open to **all topics of study**
* Open **peer-review of completion**
* Heavy reliance on **open learning resources**
* A culture of open **sharing and peer support**

**“Mastery”** is relative to your field of study.  We define it as a level of competence which would allow you to be considered a peer of others who are working professionally in your chosen field of study.  For example, if you were to complete an Open Masters in Facilitating Conflict Resolution, a professional conflict resolution organization would consider you qualified to be hired to lead an engagement with them.  If you completed an Open Masters in Epistemology, fellow philosophers would be eager to invite you to dinner to talk with you about the interesting questions you are posing to the field.

**“Champions”** are anyone in the world who wants to support you, encourage you, and stay up-to-date on your progress.

**“Study Buddies”** are peers in your Open Masters experience who meet with you occasionally to bear witness to your accomplishments, ask reflective questions, challenge you to go further, etc.  They are not expected to play an active role in your Open Masters experience, but they are confidants, sounding boards, reality checkers, and fun checkers.

**“Mentor(s)”** are guides, counselors, advisors, or coaches with deep experience in the fields you want to explore.  These persons do not necessarily have to play an active, daily role in your course of study, but (s)he may help you focus your study plan, connect you with important resources and people, and help push you to explore topics you might otherwise have not.  

You may have as many mentors as you like.  For example, you could have a writing co-mentor and a business mentor.  You may have individual co-mentors or share co-mentors with others.  Your co-mentors may change throughout your journey, as your field of study changes.  At least one of your co-mentors will write one of your two required letters of endorsement at the end of this process.   

Mentorship in the Open Masters program is a two-way street- with the mentor benefitting from the wisdom, deep knowledge, networks, and many years of experience of the other, and the mentee benefiting from the unique, fresh perspective of the other, as well as from the process of coaching and teaching.

**“Teams”** are groups of Open Masters participants that provide support each other and to the broader Open Masters community.  Teams are responsible for running everything about the Open Masters experience, globally and locally.  They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can play a variety of roles, such as:

* Supporting the global community, such as:
* Supporting the process of reviewing and updating the official guidelines or expectations of the Open Masters.
* Running a journal of research coming out of the open masters community.
* Playing a specific role in a local community, such as:
* Organizing and hosting events
* Supporting a mentorship program
* Supporting a topic of theme of study, such as:
* Creating a series of Open Masters courses on Social Innovation
* Organizing a pool of entrepeneurship project-mentors
* Anything else that is needed!
